      "● A sports nutritionist who knows the demands of the specific sport should plan individual nutrition-ally adequate diets. Throughout this process, the role of overall good nutrition practices in optimising performance should be emphasised. The diet should aim to have a protein intake of 1.4–2 g/kg, a carbohy-drate intake of 4–6 g/kg, and 20% fat or more. The focus should be on low-energy/high-nutrient  density foods that provide satiety as well as food variety and a frequent meal pattern making sure that the athlete is not fatigued during training sessions. Emphasise recovery meals containing carbohydrates and protein within 30 min after training sessions to optimise recovery, and include dairy food sources to meet Recommended Dietary Intakes of calcium.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gaining muscle size and strength are common goals of many \n",
      "athletes. A successful muscle hypertrophy programme demands consideration of the overall training programme as well as nutri-tional support. The latter includes an energy-dense meal plan, with adequate carbohydrate to support training plus small serves of high-quality protein at meals and snacks.\n",
      "  The monitoring of body composition enables diet and training to \n",
      "be adjusted to optimise results. Preferred techniques should be reliable and sensitive to small but important changes while also being cost-effective, accessible and safe.\n",

A predictable small weight gain corresponding to 0.5–1 kg/week over a longer period (depending on the severity of the initial weight loss) seems to make the process easier for the athlete. Even though the athlete starts out with a suboptimal meal plan with energy intake below what is considered healthy or  appropriate for him or her, it is considered more important that the meal plan increases over time and that the athlete is committed, rather than providing an optimal meal plan that the athlete is not ready to commit to. However, for athletes with reduced BMD it is impor-tant to ensure calcium intake (about 1500 mg/day when combining the amount included in the diet and supplements) (Nattiv et al ., 2007) and adequate\n",
