# Database Notes

## General Notes
- The most important file for initiating the PostGres with pgvector enabled is the init.sql file. init.sql combined the food.sql file and the nutrition_vector.sql file
- Everything else there is currently unrelated to the postgres database and should be ignored (for now)
